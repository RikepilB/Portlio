# Portfolio — Handoff (father)

**Read this first.** Whole-project handoff. Freshest state on top, then an append-only
index of every session folder. Nothing here is ever deleted — full prose lives in each
session's own `HANDOFF.md`; this file is the map.

## How this works (tree of context)

```
docs/handoff/
  HANDOFF.md                  ← this file (father): rolling current state + session index
  .current-session            ← pointer: active session folder name (used by the hooks)
  _meta/TEMPLATE.md           ← per-session template
  <YYYY-MM-DD>-<name>/        ← one immutable folder per session
    HANDOFF.md                ← session digest: goal · done · files · failed · next
    transcript.md             ← optional full /export archive
```

**Rules:** append, never overwrite. Only the father's `## Current state` is replaced each
session. Solved tasks → one concrete one-liner (file / PR / command).

**Claude harness fix — plan ready, not executed.** `feat/portfolio-additions` @ `c5e3abf`. Plan: `.cursor/plans/fix_claude_harness_453ff0c8.plan.md`. Handoff files touched this stop (root + father tree) — 2026-07-13. **Next:** execute → root `CLAUDE.md` first.

- [2026-06-30-scaffold-and-handoff-migration](2026-06-30-scaffold-and-handoff-migration/HANDOFF.md) — ran `project-scaffold` + migrated legacy `handoff.md`; deep-catch-up roadmap briefing; added El Umbral project (`7259831`) and updated résumé PDF + journey/embedded data (`0e48ad9`); mirrored next-steps to GitHub issues #11–#15; tested + pushed both branches and opened PR #16, PR #17; reordered home "My Work" to 5 newest projects + gave El Umbral an image (`602a52a`, `44125e0`, not pushed)
